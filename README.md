Hello, I am Diego Gonzalez Rodriguez.

I am interested in videogames and programming in general.  I am learning new tools, languages, and concepts everyday to grow as a software engineer.

I am currently learning to use and extend the Unreal Engine and am applying to job opportunities.

Nice to meet you, here are a handful of demonstrations of code I have implemented.  Inspired by Dungeon Crawlers and Crafting RPGs, by mixing the mechanics with a hexagonal grid instead of a cartesian grid.  I learned to manipulate hexagonal coordinates from the references at the website https://www.redblobgames.com/
